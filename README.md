# A PDF Reader in Java

## TODO

* [ ] Learn what a _Module_ is in **Java**.
* [ ] Create or borrow a custom **JavaFX** layout for a GUI app with tabs.
* [ ] Make the user interface for the main page look good and functional.
* [ ] Add a **Java PDF library** that can read metadata, properties, and render any PDF file.
* [ ] Use CSS to fix the parts of the page that aren't affected by the **_Transit_** **JavaFX** theme.
* [ ] Add a feature that allows the user to change between dark and light themes.
* [ ] Add a _TTS_ (*T*ext *T*o *S*peech) feature that also highlights each word that is spoken.
* [ ] Add a start-up page when the app is opened for the first time.
* [ ] Add a feature that allows for conversion between PDF to another file format. (All except for _MS Office/LibreOffice_ file formats.)
* If **Gradle** doesn't work out for this project, switch to **Maven**.
